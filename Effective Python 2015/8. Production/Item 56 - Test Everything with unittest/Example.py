"""
Things to Remember
The only way to have confidence in a Python program is to write tests.
The unittest built-in module provides most of the facilities you¡¯ll need to write good tests.
You can define tests by subclassing TestCase and defining one method per behavior you¡¯d like to test. Test methods on TestCase classes must
start with the word test.
It¡¯s important to write both unit tests (for isolated functionality) and integration tests (for modules that interact).
