"""
Things to Remember
There are two major versions of Python still in active use: Python 2 and Python 3.
There are multiple popular runtimes for Python: CPython, Jython, IronPython, PyPy, etc.
Be sure that the command-line for running Python on your system is the version you expect it to be.
Prefer Python 3 for your next project because that is the primary focus of the Python community.
