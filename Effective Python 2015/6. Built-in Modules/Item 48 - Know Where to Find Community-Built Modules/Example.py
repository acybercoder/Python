"""
Things to Remember
The Python Package Index (PyPI) contains a wealth of common packages that are built and maintained by the Python community.
pip is the command-line tool to use for installing packages from PyPI.
pip is installed by default in Python 3.4 and above; you must install it yourself for older versions.
The majority of PyPI modules are free and open source software.
